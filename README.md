# From Data to Decisions: Classifying Man of the Match in IPL

## Overview
This project aims to develop a classification model to identify the "Man of the Match" in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches based on player performance metrics. The goal is to use data-driven insights to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes various features related to player performance, match details, and historical data. Key attributes include:
- **Player Statistics**: Runs scored, wickets taken, strike rate, etc.
- **Match Information**: Venue, opponent, match type, etc.
- **Awards**: Man of the Match designations.

## Problem Statement
The primary objective is to classify players as the "Man of the Match" or not based on their performances in different matches. This classification problem will utilize machine learning techniques to create an effective model.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for the classification.
3. **Model Training**: Utilizing various algorithms, including:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - AdaBoost
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- **Best Performing Model**: SVM, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost achieved an accuracy of **76.4%**.
- **Class Imbalance**: Addressed to improve the model's performance on unseen data.

## Future Work
- Explore deep learning algorithms for potentially higher accuracy.
- Update the model periodically with new data.
- Address imbalanced data through resampling techniques.
- Consider adding more features to enhance predictive power.
